![Anna with her dog Cody](./../../static/uploads/anna-profile.jpg)

Hi, my name is Anna and I love dogs! I am an experienced, certified pet groomer and I love what I do.

In my free time, youâ€™ll find me at the park with my Golden Retriever named Cody. You'll see him featured throughout my website.

I also love watching movies and am grateful for services like Netflix! Combine a movie with some pizza, candy, and Cody by my side, and I am a happy girl!
