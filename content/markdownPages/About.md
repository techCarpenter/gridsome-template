# About Me

![Anna with her dog Cody](../../src/assets/images/anna-profile.jpg)

Hi, my name is Anna and I love dogs! I am an experienced, certified pet groomer and I love what I do. In my free time youâ€™ll find me at the park with my Golden Retriever, Cody, who you will see featured throughout this Facebook page! I also love watching movies and am grateful for services like Netflix! Combine a movie with some pizza and candy, with Cody at my side, and I am a happy girl!
